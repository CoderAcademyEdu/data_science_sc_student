    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[SaS](https://www.sas.com/en_au/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html) defines machine learning as the following...\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Machine learning** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of **artificial intelligence** based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into this with an example, mainly the example of Spotify's recommendation system - which uses a machine learning algorithm to tailor music preferences to each customer. This [blogpost](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2018/08/27/how-spotify-already-knows-your-next-favourite-song/) from Holly Whiftield at UniMelb does a great job of explaining what goes into Spotify's recommendation engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify's algorithm takes in four types of information...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The song titles from your library\n",
    "2. Audio information from your library\n",
    "3. Your most recently played playlists\n",
    "4. The playlists of your network - meaning people who listen to _similar_ songs as yourself, but aren't you\n",
    "\n",
    "It then uses this to create the following simple workflow.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **machine learning** portion decodes this inputted information and combines it to produce your [**Discover Weekly**](https://www.spotify.com/discoverweekly/) playlist. Now you might ask, what machine learning is used? I'll ping a few questions back at you to ponder...\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does a machine know **what song titles are similar**? It's not quite an obvious thing...and the field of [**Natural Language Processing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) helps out with this.\n",
    "* How does a machine know **what audio files are similar**? Sound information is complex...I mean look at a raw sound wave below and tell me what **features** you would be able to pick from it.\n",

    "* How do we jointly combine similar playlists? This is called [**Collaborative Filtering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering), which helps a machine learn similarities based upon music taste.\n",

    "\n",
    "This class will feature six weeks of content around machine learning fundamentals. We'll cover some of the main algortihms used in practice, when it's appropriate to use these algorithms, and expose you to some of the fundamental processes used by data scinetists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully by the end of this you'll have an idea about how to introduce machine learning within your organisation, and the skills required to successfully implement machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an outline of this week and weeks to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 1: Probability and Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about data we collect, all of our data is usually categorized by **processes** that happen around us. Maybe we're observing weather patterns, or capturing information on mobile network traffic. If we want to start finding patterns in our data, we need to start thinking about\n",
    "\n",
    "* modeling our data\n",
    "* the randomness that governs these processes\n",
    "* and relationships between these processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are really good at number crunching...and not much else, which is why machine learning comes from a large mathematical foundation, mostly governed by probability and statistics. So, we'll start there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 2: Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then cover our first learning algorithm...called **linear regression**, something some of you might be familar with. If you've ever draw a trendline in excel, the process that creates that trendline uses linear regression. We'll try to **predict** some continuous variable, say the price of a house, based upon a collection of data that is related to housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 3: Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so we've trained a machine learning algorithm, but how do we know if it's _good_? **Cross-validation** is the process of **tuning** an algorithm, to make sure that it is an **accurate** description of how we believe our model should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 4: Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, linear regression works really well in predicting continuous variables, but is not great at predicting **categorical variables**. A categorical variable, as it sounds, is based upon a category...for instance whether an image on my phone contains my face...or not. **Logistic regression** is very similar to linear regression, and can be used to predict categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 5: Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is not always great though, especially when we have a lot of **complex information**. On the other hand, **neural networks**, the model that is fueling our current buzz around data science, work really well to find complex relationships, as long we have enough data. We'll take a brief look at what a neural network is, why it's become so popular, and some use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 6: Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "During our last week, we'll take a look at machine learning from a different lens. We've been doing a lot of prediction, which assumes we know what we want to predict. But what happens if our data doesn't have a specific predictor variable? Maybe I have a bunch of data that represents my customers, and I just want to find **some interesting patterns?**. We'll conclude the course with a discussion on **clustering**, which is a form of **unsupervised learning**.\n",
